# Horiseon code revised

## HTML file

* Went into my html file and got rid of all of the divs that were previously there replacing them with navs, sections, articles, ul's, and li's.  

* Made sure the search engine optomization tag was linked properly
 

## CSS file

* There was too much repetitive code in the original file so I went in and condenced some of the classes into 1


## Pictures

* Final adjustment made to this project was adding ALT tags to all the photos with a detailed discription for the impaired.
